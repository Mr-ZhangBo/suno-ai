## Description

Suno Ai Free was launched around April this year; it is currently a project that has been validated and made profitable in overseas markets. With an awareness of open source and collaboration, we hope to incubate superior commercialized projects based on this open-source project, to better meet the demands of overseas markets. All code is completely open-source and usable.
